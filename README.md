# Angular CRUD (Client Side)

## Introduction

This project is a client management system that allows users to create, update, delete, and display clients. The system stores client information in the browser's local memory, making it easy to access the data from any device.

The system has been developed by Saeed Rajabi using the latest web development technologies. The aim of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing clients, allowing businesses to save time and improve their customer service.

## Features

The following are some of the key features of the client management system:

Create new clients: Users can easily add new clients to the system by entering their details such as name, email, and phone number.

Update existing clients: Users can also update the details of existing clients if they need to make any changes.

Delete clients: If a client is no longer needed, users can easily remove them from the system.

Display clients: Users can view a list of all the clients stored in the system and search for specific clients using filters such as name or email.

## Installation

To install the client management system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install in the terminal.

Start the system by running npm start in the terminal.

## Usage

Once the system is running, you can access it by opening your preferred web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

From there, you can create new clients by clicking on the "Add Client" button and filling out the required information. To update or delete existing clients, simply click on the corresponding buttons next to each client in the list view.

You can also use the search bar at the top of the page to filter clients by name or email.



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
